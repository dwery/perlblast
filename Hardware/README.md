This is the programming hardware as I use it now. It has a base board with a LPT connector. It needs to be used 
with a LPT on the motherboard or with a USB<->LPT dongle BUT A SPECIAL ONE!. You need one with a Lucent compatible chip.
There exits a few chip versions that are suitable.

I tried to minimize the chance that hazardous voltages could leave the board into the LPT port, probably
you blow up local components first in case of incident.

The base board has connectors to hold a programming board. The programming board holds the ZIF socket and signal LED's.

There exist one programming board for 20 pin ZIF's and one for 24 pin ZIF's.

'perlblast_nh' will run smootly with this hardware.
